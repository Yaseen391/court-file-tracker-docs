  <h1>Court File Tracker Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 17, 2025</p>
  <p>Court File Tracker is a Progressive Web App designed to help court staff manage file records securely. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring your data remains safe.</p>
  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>- We collect minimal data, including admin profile details (name, photo), file fetcher profiles, and file records (CMS number, dates, etc.), stored locally on your device using localForage.<br>
  - If you enable Google Drive backups, data is stored in your Google Drive account under the appâ€™s folder, accessible only by you.</p>
  <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>- Your data is used solely to provide app functionality, such as tracking file deliveries and generating reports.<br>
  - We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to third parties.</p>
  <h2>3. Google Drive Integration</h2>
  <p>- The app uses Google Drive API (scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file) to back up and restore data.<br>
  - Access is granted with your consent via Google Sign-In, and only files created by the app are accessed.</p>
  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>- Data is stored securely on your device and encrypted in transit to Google Drive via HTTPS.<br>
  - You are responsible for securing your device and Google account.</p>
